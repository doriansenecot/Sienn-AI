2. Look for a binomial factor. We need to find two terms whose product is (x^2 - y^2). 
Since this is a difference of two squares, we can factor it as:

(x^2 - y^2) = (x - y)(x + y)

It occurs when particles are in their wave-like state, which is the case for most particles at room temperature. The probability of quantum tunneling depends on the energy of the particle, the height and width of the barrier, and the temperature of the environment. Generally speaking, the higher the temperature, the higher the probability of quantum tunneling.",
