What is Python?,,"Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It emphasizes code readability with significant whitespace and has a comprehensive standard library."
How do you create a list in Python?,,"To create a list in Python, use square brackets: my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Lists are mutable, ordered collections that can contain mixed data types."
What is the difference between a list and a tuple?,,"A list is mutable (can be modified) and uses square brackets [], while a tuple is immutable (cannot be changed) and uses parentheses (). Tuples are more memory-efficient."
How do you write a for loop in Python?,,"Use the syntax: for variable in iterable: followed by indented code. Example: for i in range(10): print(i) iterates from 0 to 9."
What is a function in Python?,,"A function is a reusable block of code defined with the 'def' keyword: def my_function(param1, param2): return result. Functions help organize code and promote reusability."
How do you install a Python package?,,"Use pip, Python's package manager: pip install package_name. For a specific version use pip install package_name==1.2.3. Use pip install -r requirements.txt for multiple packages."
What is a Python dictionary?,,"A dictionary is a mutable, unordered collection of key-value pairs: my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}. Keys must be immutable (strings, numbers, tuples)."
How do you read a file in Python?,,"Use a context manager for safe file handling: with open('file.txt', 'r') as f: content = f.read(). The file is automatically closed even if an error occurs."
What is the difference between == and is?,,"The == operator compares values for equality, while 'is' compares object identity (memory address). Use == for value comparison and 'is' for singletons like None."
How do you handle exceptions in Python?,,"Use try-except blocks: try: risky_operation() except ValueError as e: print(f'Error: {e}') except Exception as e: print(e) finally: cleanup(). The finally block always executes."
What is a class in Python?,,"A class is a blueprint for creating objects with attributes and methods: class Person: def __init__(self, name): self.name = name. Objects are instances of classes."
How do you create a lambda function?,,"A lambda is an anonymous function: lambda arguments: expression. Example: square = lambda x: x**2. Often used with map(), filter(), and sorted()."
What is list comprehension?,,"A concise way to create lists: [expression for item in iterable if condition]. Example: [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0] creates [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]."
How do you import a module in Python?,,"Use 'import module_name' to import entire module, 'from module import function' for specific items, or 'import module as alias' for shorter names."
What is a decorator in Python?,,"A decorator is a function that modifies another function's behavior. Use @decorator_name above function definition. Example: @staticmethod, @property, or custom decorators."
How do you create a virtual environment?,,"Use python -m venv env_name to create. Activate with: source env_name/bin/activate (Unix/Mac) or env_name\Scripts\activate.bat (Windows). Deactivate with: deactivate."
What is the difference between append and extend?,,"append() adds a single element to list end: list.append(1). extend() adds all elements from iterable: list.extend([1,2,3]). append adds 1 item, extend adds multiple."
How do you sort a list in Python?,,"Use list.sort() to sort in-place or sorted(list) for new sorted list. Add reverse=True for descending order. Use key parameter for custom sorting: sorted(words, key=len)."
What is self in Python?,,"self is a reference to the current instance of a class, used in instance methods. It's the first parameter of instance methods (by convention, not a keyword)."
How do you create a generator in Python?,,"Use yield instead of return: def my_gen(): for i in range(10): yield i. Generators are memory-efficient iterators that compute values on-demand."
What is the purpose of __init__?,,"__init__ is the constructor method called when creating a class instance. It initializes object attributes: def __init__(self, name): self.name = name."
How do you handle multiple exceptions?,,"Use multiple except clauses: except (ValueError, TypeError) as e: or separate blocks: except ValueError: ... except TypeError: ... Handle specific before general exceptions."
What is the difference between shallow and deep copy?,,"Shallow copy (copy.copy()) creates new object but references nested objects. Deep copy (copy.deepcopy()) creates completely independent copy of all nested objects."
How do you use string formatting in Python?,,"Use f-strings (Python 3.6+): f'Hello {name}'. Also .format(): 'Hello {}'.format(name) or old style: 'Hello %s' % name. f-strings are fastest and most readable."
What is a Python module?,,"A module is a .py file containing Python code (functions, classes, variables). Import with 'import module_name'. Modules organize code into logical units."
How do you create a docstring?,,"Use triple quotes after function/class definition: def func(): '''This function does X'''. Access via help(func) or func.__doc__. Follow PEP 257 conventions."
What is if __name__ == '__main__'?,,"This checks if script is run directly vs imported. Code inside only executes when script is main program, not when imported as module."
How do you iterate over a dictionary?,,"Use .items() for key-value pairs: for k, v in dict.items():. Use .keys() for keys only or .values() for values only. Direct iteration gives keys."
What is list slicing in Python?,,"Extract portions with [start:end:step]. Examples: list[1:5] gets indices 1-4, list[:3] first 3 items, list[::2] every 2nd item, list[::-1] reverses list."
How do you reverse a list in Python?,,"Three ways: list.reverse() modifies in-place, list[::-1] creates reversed copy, or reversed(list) returns reverse iterator. Choose based on memory/mutability needs."
What is the difference between break and continue?,,"break exits loop completely, continuing after loop. continue skips current iteration and jumps to next iteration. Both work in for and while loops."
How do you read command-line arguments?,,"Use sys.argv for simple args: import sys; args = sys.argv[1:]. For advanced parsing use argparse: parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(); parser.add_argument('name')."
What is a Python package?,,"A package is a directory containing modules and __init__.py file. It organizes related modules hierarchically. Import with: from package import module."
How do you check the type of a variable?,,"Use type(var) to get type object: type(5) returns <class 'int'>. Use isinstance(var, type) to check: isinstance(5, int) returns True. isinstance handles inheritance."
What is the purpose of pass in Python?,,"pass is a null statement that does nothing. Used as placeholder when syntax requires statement but no action needed: def todo(): pass or if x > 5: pass."
How do you concatenate strings in Python?,,"Use + operator: 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World', .join() for lists: ' '.join(['Hello', 'World']), or f-strings: f'{s1} {s2}'. join() is most efficient for many strings."
What is the global keyword?,,"global declares variable refers to global scope, not local. Allows modifying global variables inside functions: global count; count += 1. Use sparingly."
How do you create a set in Python?,,"Use curly braces or set(): my_set = {1, 2, 3} or set([1, 2, 3]). Sets contain unique elements only and support set operations (union, intersection)."
What is the difference between remove and pop?,,"remove(value) removes first occurrence of value, raises ValueError if not found. pop(index) removes and returns element at index, raises IndexError if invalid."
How do you format numbers in Python?,,"Use f-strings with format specs: f'{num:.2f}' for 2 decimals, f'{num:,}' for thousands separator, f'{num:>10}' for right-align in 10 spaces, f'{num:.2%}' for percentage."
What is the purpose of try-except-else?,,"else block executes only if no exception occurred in try block. Use for code that should run only on success but doesn't need protection itself."
How do you create a list of numbers?,,"Use range(): list(range(10)) gives [0-9], list(range(1,11)) gives [1-10]. For floats use numpy.arange() or loop: [i/10 for i in range(10)]."
What is the zip function in Python?,,"zip() combines multiple iterables element-wise into tuples: list(zip([1,2], ['a','b'])) returns [(1,'a'), (2,'b')]. Stops at shortest iterable length."
How do you define default function arguments?,,"Set default in definition: def func(a, b=10, c='default'): Default arguments must come after positional. Evaluated once at definition time."
What is the enumerate function?,,"enumerate() adds counter to iterable: for i, val in enumerate(['a','b']): gives (0,'a'), (1,'b'). Start parameter: enumerate(list, start=1) for 1-based indexing."
How do you convert string to integer?,,"Use int() function: num = int('123') converts to 123. Specify base: int('FF', 16) for hex. Raises ValueError for invalid strings. Use int(float('3.7')) for float strings."
What is the map function in Python?,,"map(function, iterable) applies function to all items: list(map(lambda x: x**2, [1,2,3])) returns [1,4,9]. Returns iterator in Python 3."
How do you check if key exists in dictionary?,,"Use 'in' operator: if 'key' in dict: or dict.get('key') which returns None (or default) if key missing. Better than KeyError risk."
What is the filter function?,,"filter(function, iterable) returns items where function returns True: list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, [-1,0,1,2])) returns [1,2]. Returns iterator."
How do you create an empty dictionary?,,"Use {} or dict(): my_dict = {} or my_dict = dict(). To create with default values use dict.fromkeys(keys, value)."
What is the difference between is and ==?,,"'is' tests object identity (same object in memory), '==' tests value equality. a is b means id(a) == id(b). Use 'is' for None, True, False."
How do you use *args and **kwargs?,,"*args collects positional arguments as tuple: def f(*args). **kwargs collects keyword arguments as dict: def f(**kwargs). Use both: def f(*args, **kwargs)."
What is the difference between Python 2 and 3?,,"Python 3 (released 2008) has print as function print(), better Unicode support, integer division returns float, and many improvements. Python 2 reached EOL in 2020."
How do you create multiple variables at once?,,"Use tuple unpacking: a, b, c = 1, 2, 3 or a = b = c = 0 for same value. Also works with lists: x, y = [1, 2]. Number of variables must match values."
What is the purpose of return in a function?,,"return statement exits function and optionally returns value to caller: def add(a,b): return a+b. Without return, function returns None implicitly."
How do you comment code in Python?,,"Use # for single-line comments: # This is a comment. For multi-line use triple quotes: '''Multi-line comment''' or docstrings. Comments explain why, not what."
What is the len() function?,,"len() returns number of items in sequence or collection: len([1,2,3]) returns 3, len('hello') returns 5, len({'a':1}) returns 1. Works on sequences and containers."
How do you check if a value is in a list?,,"Use 'in' operator: if 5 in my_list: returns True/False. Also works with 'not in': if 5 not in my_list:. O(n) time complexity for lists."
What is the difference between / and // operators?,,"/ is true division (always returns float): 5/2 = 2.5. // is floor division (returns integer): 5//2 = 2. Use // when you need integer result."
How do you convert list to string?,,"Use .join(): ','.join(['a','b','c']) returns 'a,b,c'. Works only with string lists. For mixed types: ','.join(map(str, list)). join is on separator, not list."
What is the range() function?,,"range(start, stop, step) generates sequence of numbers. range(5) gives 0-4, range(1,6) gives 1-5, range(0,10,2) gives 0,2,4,6,8. Returns range object, not list."
How do you create a multi-line string?,,"Use triple quotes: text = '''Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3''' or """multi-line""". Preserves line breaks and indentation. Good for docstrings and long text."
What is the purpose of None in Python?,,"None represents absence of value (null). It's a singleton object. Use to initialize variables, default function returns, or indicate no result. Test with 'is None'."
How do you copy a list in Python?,,"Use slice: new_list = old_list[:] or copy(): import copy; new_list = copy.copy(old_list) or list(): new_list = list(old_list). Direct assignment doesn't copy!"
What is the abs() function?,,"abs() returns absolute value (magnitude) of number: abs(-5) returns 5, abs(3.14) returns 3.14, abs(-2+3j) returns 3.605 (for complex). Always non-negative."
How do you find the maximum value in a list?,,"Use max() function: max([1,5,3,2]) returns 5. For custom comparison: max(words, key=len) finds longest. Also works with multiple arguments: max(1,2,3)."
What is string concatenation?,,"Joining strings together. Use + operator: 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World', f-strings: f'{s1} {s2}', or .join(): ''.join(['a','b']). + creates new string each time."
How do you check if string starts with prefix?,,"Use str.startswith(): 'hello'.startswith('he') returns True. Check multiple: 'hello'.startswith(('he','ha')). Also str.endswith() for suffix checking."
What is the round() function?,,"round(number, digits) rounds to specified decimals: round(3.14159, 2) returns 3.14. round(4.5) returns 4 (banker's rounding). For ceiling/floor use math module."
How do you convert string to lowercase?,,"Use str.lower(): 'HELLO'.lower() returns 'hello'. For uppercase use .upper(). For title case: .title(). For swap: .swapcase(). These don't modify original string."
What is the split() method?,,"str.split(separator) splits string into list: 'a,b,c'.split(',') returns ['a','b','c']. Default separator is whitespace. Limit with maxsplit: split(',',1)."
How do you remove whitespace from string?,,"Use .strip() to remove from both ends: '  hello  '.strip() returns 'hello'. .lstrip() for left, .rstrip() for right. Pass chars to remove: strip('.')."
What is the replace() method?,,"str.replace(old, new, count) replaces occurrences: 'hello'.replace('l','L') returns 'heLLo'. Count limits replacements. Returns new string, doesn't modify original."
How do you get string length?,,"Use len() function: len('hello') returns 5. Counts characters including spaces and special chars. For bytes use len(string.encode('utf-8'))."
What is the index() method?,,"list.index(value) returns first index of value: [1,2,3,2].index(2) returns 1. Raises ValueError if not found. Use with try-except or check with 'in' first."

What is the all() function?,,"all(iterable) returns True if all elements are truthy: all([True, True, True]) returns True. all([]) returns True. Short-circuits on first False."
How do you unpack a list?,,"Use * operator: a, *b, c = [1,2,3,4,5] gives a=1, b=[2,3,4], c=5. Also in function calls: print(*[1,2,3]) passes as separate arguments."
What is the ord() function?,,"ord() returns Unicode code point of character: ord('A') returns 65. Inverse is chr(): chr(65) returns 'A'. Useful for character arithmetic."
How do you find minimum value in list?,,"Use min() function: min([5,1,3]) returns 1. With key: min(words, key=len) finds shortest. Multiple args: min(1,2,3). Raises ValueError on empty sequence."

How do you check if list is empty?,,"Use if not list: or if len(list) == 0:. First is Pythonic. Empty list is falsy. For explicit: if list == []:. Works for any empty sequence."
What is the pow() function?,,"pow(base, exp, mod) computes base**exp: pow(2,3) returns 8. Three args: pow(2,3,5) returns (2**3) % 5 = 3. More efficient than ** for large modular exponentiation."
How do you reverse a string?,,"Use slicing: string[::-1] reverses 'hello' to 'olleh'. Or ''.join(reversed(string)). Slicing is simplest. Returns new string, original unchanged."
What is the isinstance() function?,,"isinstance(obj, type) checks if object is instance of type: isinstance(5, int) returns True. Accepts tuple of types: isinstance(x, (int,float)). Handles inheritance."
How do you clear a list?,,"Use list.clear() to remove all items: my_list.clear(). Or assign empty list: my_list = []. Or del my_list[:]. clear() is most explicit and clear."
What is the type() function?,,"type(obj) returns object's type: type(5) returns <class 'int'>. Use for getting type. For checking use isinstance() which handles inheritance better."

What is the format() method?,,"String formatting: '{} {}'.format('Hello', 'World') returns 'Hello World'. Named: '{name}'.format(name='Alice'). With specs: '{:.2f}'.format(3.14159) returns '3.14'."
How do you open a file for writing?,,"Use with open('file.txt', 'w') as f: f.write('content'). 'w' overwrites file. 'a' appends. 'x' creates new (fails if exists). Always use context manager."
What is the strip() method?,,"Removes leading/trailing characters: '  hello  '.strip() returns 'hello'. Pass chars: 'xxxhelloxxx'.strip('x') returns 'hello'. Default removes whitespace."
